label.faqs.page.ans6=No not at all, you have a professional within UAE who is responsible for everything. You have better control, access, reliability, internally audited data &amp; reporting.

label.faqs.page.ques11=<span class="faqsHeading">What are the Setup Charges?</span><br />
label.faqs.page.ans11=No cost. No doubt we incur setup charges for connecting your system to the VPN but we are confident that our quality shall support your decision to use our service. We, therefore absorb the entire setup charges. <br /><br />
label.faqs.page.ques12=<span class="faqsHeading">I would not like to provide any access to my computer to you. Can I still use your services?</span><br />

label.faqs.page.ques14=<span class="faqsHeading">I like having an extra employee around here to help with other things.</span><br />
label.faqs.page.ans14=This is one objection we cannot answer. If you need someone to make coffee and fill his or her day with other small tasks, outsourced bookkeeping is not for you. But let me ask you this, &quot;How easy is it to find a good bookkeeper that knows QuickBooks&reg;, MYOB&reg; or Peachtree&reg;?&quot; Aren't you tired of the never-ending cycle of problems caused by the entire process?<br /><br />
